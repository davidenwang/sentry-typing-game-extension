# Sentry Themed Typing Game

Built for Sentry's 2023 HackWeek, upon typing the keyphrase "DESTROY ALL BUGS" on the issue's list with this extension enabled
the issue's list will transform into an interactive typing game where you must type and destroy issue titles before they
destroy the issues page!

Stretch Features
- Difficulty Modification
- WPM/Combo Tracker
- Highscores

Note: As this was a hackweek project the code is messy and still WIP.
